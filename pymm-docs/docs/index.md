pymmcore-plus is an ecosystem of Python libraries that bring Micro-Manager fully
into the Python world.  It is built on top of the C++ MMCore library, and still
has access to all of the devices built up over the history of Micro-Manager.
But it re-implements in Python all of the application-side logic that had been
written in Java, adding a lot of new features and functionality along the way.
